# Audit-Ready AWS Identity, Trust, and Boundary Evidence

## Subheadline
Produce defensible, auditor-ready evidence for AWS identity, access, trust relationships, boundaries, logging, and inventory.  
Built specifically for auditors and internal GRC teams who need clarity, not dashboards.

---

## Primary Calls to Action
- **View Sample Audit Evidence**
- **See Supported Audit Domains**

---

## Credibility and Access Model
Works with native AWS services including IAM, CloudTrail, Config, Security Hub, and AWS SSO.  
No agents. Read-only access. Designed for audit use.

---

## AWS Is Complex. Auditors Need Clear Answers.

AWS generates massive amounts of identity, configuration, and logging data.  
Auditors are expected to interpret that data accurately, even when it spans users, roles, access keys, SSO, federated identity, and cross-account trust.

Blackbox Auditor turns AWS complexity into **clear, review-ready audit evidence** that answers the questions auditors actually ask.

---

## Audit Evidence Domains

### Identity, Privilege, and Access Evidence (AWS IAMScan / RoleScan)
Understand **who can authenticate**, **how they authenticate**, and **what level of access they have**.

- IAM users, groups, permissions, and admin-level access  
- Access keys, usage, age, and risk indicators  
- Password policy, MFA enforcement, and root user activity  
- Privilege clarity that goes beyond raw IAM policy data  

Auditors no longer need to interpret JSON or guess at effective permissions.

---

### Federated Access and Trust Evidence
Surface access paths auditors commonly miss.

- AWS SSO and federated identity in use  
- Role-based permissions tied to federated access  
- Cross-account roles and trust relationships  
- Clear visibility into which external accounts can access this environment  

Federated access and role trust are highlighted, explained, and mapped to effective permissions.

---

### External Boundary and Scope Evidence (AWS BoundaryScan)
Define system boundaries with confidence.

- Comprehensive identification of external-facing services  
- IP addresses, DNS names, and exposed endpoints by AWS service  
- Eliminates reliance on incomplete client-provided inventories  

Auditors gain confidence that scope and boundaries are complete.

---

### Logging Sufficiency and Integrity Evidence (AWS Logging Scan)
Move beyond “logging enabled” checkboxes.

- What is logged and where logs are stored  
- Retention periods and encryption status  
- Access controls and tamper protection  
- Evidence aligned to audit sufficiency expectations  

Supports defensible conclusions around logging and monitoring controls.

---

### Audit-Scoped AWS Asset Inventory (AWS InventoryScan)
Know exactly what exists in the audit scope.

- Compute, storage, networking, and managed services auditors care about  
- VPCs, subnets, EC2, ECS, EKS, Lambda, S3, RDS, DynamoDB, and more  
- Consolidated into clear, auditor-friendly tables  

Supports scoping, sampling, and completeness assertions.

---

## Not a Cloud Security Posture Management Tool. Not a Security Dashboard.

Blackbox Auditor does not score risk, monitor threats, or replace security tooling.

It exists to solve one problem:  
**producing accurate, defensible AWS audit evidence that auditors can understand and rely on.**

---

## Built For

- External auditors performing AWS-based assessments  
- Internal GRC teams supporting SOC 2, PCI DSS, ISO 27001, and HIPAA audits  
- Security teams tired of translating AWS data into audit language  

### Not Built For
- Real-time threat detection  
- Security posture scoring  
- Cloud architecture design

## Why Auditors and GRC Teams Use Blackbox Auditor

- Highlights access paths and risks auditors commonly miss  
- Eliminates manual IAM interpretation and spreadsheet analysis  
- Improves consistency across audit cycles  
- Produces repeatable, defensible evidence artifacts
