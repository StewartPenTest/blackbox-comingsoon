# Manual AWS Audit Review vs Blackbox Auditor

## Reducing Audit Cost While Improving Evidence Quality

External auditors are under sustained cost pressure.

Budgets are tighter.  
Fee compression is real.  
Review expectations are increasing.

Manual AWS audit procedures consume senior auditor time, introduce inconsistency, and drive up engagement cost.

Blackbox Auditor exists to reverse that equation.

## The Cost Reality of Manual AWS Reviews

Manual AWS access and scope reviews typically involve:

- Exporting data from multiple AWS services  
- Interpreting complex IAM and trust relationships  
- Manually validating scope and exposure  
- Reworking evidence after review comments  

This work is usually performed by senior staff because junior auditors lack the AWS depth required.

That model does not scale.

## Side-by-Side Comparison

### Manual AWS Audit Review

- 3–6+ hours per account for IAM, trust, and boundary review  
- Requires senior auditor involvement  
- High risk of missed access paths  
- Inconsistent evidence quality across engagements  
- Difficult to reproduce or re-perform  

### Blackbox Auditor

- Automated evidence generation in minutes  
- Junior staff can execute reviews confidently  
- Comprehensive coverage of IAM, federation, trust, and boundaries  
- Consistent, repeatable evidence outputs  
- Review-ready artifacts aligned to audit expectations

## ROI Driver #1: Immediate Time Savings

Consider a conservative example:

- Manual AWS review time: **4 hours**  
- Average billable rate: **$250/hour**  
- Manual review cost: **$1,000**  

With Blackbox Auditor:

- Review time reduced to **~2 hours**  
- Review cost: **$500**  
- Tool cost: **less than the cost of the time saved**  

**Result:**  
The tool pays for itself on the first use.

Every subsequent use increases margin.

## ROI Driver #2: Pushing Work Down Without Losing Quality

AWS audit work is often bottlenecked at senior levels.

Blackbox Auditor changes the staffing model:

- Junior auditors execute data collection and analysis  
- Senior auditors focus on judgment and review  
- Evidence quality remains consistent and defensible  

This allows firms to:
- Reduce reliance on senior hours  
- Improve engagement margin  
- Scale AWS audit work without scaling cost  

**Expert-level outputs, produced by junior staff.**

## What Blackbox Auditor Replaces

Blackbox Auditor eliminates the need for:

- Manual IAM policy review  
- Spreadsheet-based access analysis  
- Client-authored access and scope summaries  
- One-off scripts and ad hoc exports  

The result is faster execution with fewer review comments.

---

## Why This Matters Under Fee Pressure

Under fixed or compressed fees:

- Time overruns erode margin  
- Rework kills profitability  
- Inconsistent evidence increases review risk  

Blackbox Auditor directly addresses these pressures by reducing hours, standardizing outputs, and lowering execution risk.

---

## Designed for Audit Economics

Blackbox Auditor is built around how audits are priced and staffed:

- Predictable effort  
- Repeatable outputs  
- Clear cost justification  

It is not a security tool pretending to be an audit solution.
